## Tools and Materials

### Engine:
We will be using the [baseline](https://web.dev/baseline) web browser because we are all familiar with it and we can easily bring in TypeScript/JavaScript libraries to implement 3D graphics, rendering, and physics. For the 3D libraries, we will be relying on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js). It looks like there is a lot of documentation and tutorials on how to set everything up and a large community for these two libraries, so we can most likely find help here if nobody in our group or class is able to help us with a super specific problem.

### Languages:
The main languages that we are using throughout the project are JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as JSON. We are all confident with these scripting languages, and JSON is readable and it is very easy to read and write JSON data with JavaScript and TypeScript. We may use different data languages like XML or YAML, but sticking with JSON is preferable.

### Tools:
The tools that we expect to use within the project are [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). The reason why we chose these two IDE tools is because we are already very familiar with both platforms and both are very easy to use and access. We are also planning to use [Deno](https://deno.com/) as our JavaScript runner and TypeScript compiler. For asset creation, we plan on using [PixilArt](https://www.pixilart.com/) editor, because we are pretty familiar with it from using it in CMPM 80K and CMPM 120.

### Generative AI:
We do not plan to heavily rely on GenAI or any agentic tools for this project. However, we may use GenAI like [BayLeaf’s Brace](https://bayleaf.chat/?model=brace-85291) for debugging purposes and/or give us tips on how to implement certain aspects and refactoring. It has been proven effective for analyzing TypeScript/JavaScript code and helpful for debugging Demo assignment code.

## Outlook
We believe the hardest part is definitely learning about how the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)libraries and how they both function and correlate with one another, given how little time we have. We believe that by approaching the project with the tools and materials we selected above, we will learn how to develop more flexibly and how to manage our time consumption, as well as reserving ourselves to what we want to implement into the game. We will also learn when to cut our losses due to the time constraints.
